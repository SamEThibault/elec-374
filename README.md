#Phase 1 Decisions

## Typical Register Implementation

- Global Asynchronous Clear on positive edge
- Rising clock edge response
- Rising clock edge enable

2023/03/04 -- Sam Notes:

- Always remember to enable your registers in the same line as when you send signal to encoder:
  T3: begin
  #10 R2_out <= 1; Y_enable <= 1;
  #10 R2_out <= 0; Y_enable <= 0;
  end

- Never perform two operations on the same register in the same state

- Compilation of datapath TB only successful when adding module example(input a, input b);
- Infinite loop of clock cycles: Z output is not visible when simulating
- Need to modify state machine for 2-register operations
- Double-check opcode for all operations (32-bit opcode send to MdataIn)
